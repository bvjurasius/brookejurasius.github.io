Under the mentorship of Dr. Carey Shive, my research focuses on understanding how inflammation influences aging, particularly in T-regulatory cells, and its implications for autoimmune responses and vaccine efficacy. Outside the lab, I enjoy playing golf, immersing myself in the beauty of classical piano music—Beethoven being my favorite composer—and spending time with my beloved cat.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

My research under Dr. Carey Shive investigates how inflammation impacts aging in T-regulatory cells, with implications for autoimmune responses and vaccine efficacy.\nResearch and Laboratory Experience\nIn the Carey Shive Lab, I process peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and have gained expertise in flow cytometry. One of my projects involves stimulating cells with IL-7 and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF to study their effects on the regulation of homeostatic cytokine receptors. Since IL-7 is known to downregulate CD127, which initiates a signaling cascade that promotes T cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, we aimed to determine whether other cytokines similarly downregulate CD127.\nAs a Process Development Intern at Pivot Bio, I validated primers for Bradyrhizobium bacterial strains, conducted qPCR experiments, and analyzed bacterial enumeration using qPCR and viable count methods. At Applied Molecular Transport, I performed ELISA and qPCR to study the IL-22 pathway, developed a new drug proposal, and analyzed clinical datasets.\nDuring my time as a Research Assistant at Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, I designed and refined protocols for DNA extraction and PCR testing from bird feather samples, conducting bioinformatics analyses to support conservation genetics. This diverse experience has equipped me with a robust background in molecular biology and data analysis, complementing my current research endeavors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."
